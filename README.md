# WOH-RPT
WOH-RPT demo on MIRFlickr dataset.

Paper : Weakly-Supervised Online Hashing with Refined Pseudo Tags

This is a simplified demo, including:  
train.m : function to compute the hash code and hash function of training data.    
mAP.m : function to compute the mAP of hashing method.  
Kernelize.m : function to transform the original features to kernel features.  
mymain.m : example script to run the code on the MIRFLickr dataset.

## 1.download the dataset
